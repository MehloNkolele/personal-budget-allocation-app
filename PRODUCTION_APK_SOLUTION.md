### ✅ Completed Setup:
- **Web App**: Built successfully with Vite (production optimized)

### 🚧 Current Issue:
Network restrictions are preventing Gradle from downloading required dependencies from `services.gradle.org`.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Android Studio (Recommended) 🎯

**This is the most reliable solution for your network environment:**

1. **Download Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install** with default settings (includes Android SDK)
3. **Open Project**:
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Choose "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to: `android/` folder in your project
   - Let Android Studio download all dependencies automatically
4. **Build Production APK**:
   - In Android Studio: `Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)`
   - Choose "release" variant
   - APK will be created in: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

### Option 2: Different Network 🌐

Try building from a different network:
- Home internet connection
- Mobile hotspot
- Public WiFi (coffee shop, library)
- Ask IT to whitelist `services.gradle.org` and `repo1.maven.org`

### Option 3: Manual Gradle Setup 🔧

If you have access to download Gradle manually:

1. Download from different network: https://gradle.org/releases/ (Gradle 8.5)
2. Extract to: `C:\gradle\gradle-8.5`
3. Set environment variables and build

### Option 4: GitHub Actions (Online Build) ☁️

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Use GitHub Actions to build APK online
3. Download the built APK from the workflow

## Quick Test Commands

Try these commands to test your setup:

```cmd
# Test 1: Check if web build works
npm run build

# Test 2: Check Capacitor sync
npx cap sync

# Test 3: Try offline Gradle build (if Gradle was partially downloaded)
cd android
gradlew.bat assembleRelease --offline
```
