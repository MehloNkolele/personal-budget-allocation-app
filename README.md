## Authentication Setup

The app is configured with Firebase Authentication using the following features:
- Email/Password authentication
- Google OAuth provider
- Password reset functionality
- Secure user session management

- Sign out securely when done

### User Data Isolation
Each user has completely isolated data storage:

- **Automatic Migration**: If you had data before user accounts, it's automatically migrated to your account
- **Data Switching**: When you switch between user accounts, you only see your own data
- **Data Management**: You can clear all your data from the user settings if needed
- **Privacy**: No user can access another user's budget information
