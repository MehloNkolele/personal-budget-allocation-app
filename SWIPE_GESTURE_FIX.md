# Swipe Gesture Navigation Fix for Median.co Apps

## Problem Description

When using swipe gestures (left/right swipe) to navigate back in the mobile app, the app was closing instead of navigating to the previous screen. This happened because the app was built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React with state-based navigation, but didn't properly handle browser history for native navigation events.

## Root Cause

1. **SPA Navigation**: The app used React state (`currentSection`) for navigation instead of browser history
2. **Missing Browser History**: No proper history stack for native gestures to navigate through
3. **No Median.co Integration**: Missing integration with Median.co's JavaScript Bridge for handling native navigation events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed Median JavaScript Bridge
```bash
npm install median-js-bridge
```

### 2. Created Navigation Service (`services/navigationService.ts`)
- Centralized navigation management
- Browser history integration
- Median.co JavaScript Bridge integration
- Handles native navigation events (swipe gestures, back button)

Key features:
- `navigateToSection()`: Updates both app state and browser history
- `goBack()`: Handles back navigation with fallback to browser history
- `jsNavigation` listener: Responds to native navigation events
- URL-based navigation: Supports deep linking and proper history

### 3. Created Navigation Hook (`hooks/useNavigation.ts`)
- React hook for components to use the navigation service
- Automatic initialization from URL
- State synchronization between service and components

### 4. Updated App Components
- **App.tsx**: Uses `useNavigation` hook instead of local state
- **Navbar.tsx**: Updated to use new navigation system
- **MedianBridge.tsx**: Initializes Median JavaScript Bridge

### 5. Added Type Definitions (`types/median.d.ts`)
- TypeScript definitions for median-js-bridge package
- Proper type safety for Median API calls

## How It Works

### Navigation Flow
1. **User swipes left/right**: Native app detects gesture
2. **Median Bridge**: Calls `jsNavigation.url` listener with URL
3. **Navigation Service**: Parses URL and determines target section
4. **State Update**: Updates app state and notifies React components
5. **History Management**: Maintains browser history for proper back/forward

### URL Structure
The app now uses hash-based URLs for navigation:
- `#dashboard` - Dashboard section
- `#categories` - Categories section  
- `#reports` - Reports section
- `#planning` - Budget Planning section
- `#history` - Budget History section
- `#savings` - Savings Calculator section

### Browser History Integration
- Each navigation creates a browser history entry
- Back gestures navigate through this history
- Supports deep linking and page refresh

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `services/navigationService.ts` - Core navigation logic
- `hooks/useNavigation.ts` - React hook for navigation
- `components/MedianBridge.tsx` - Median.co integration
- `types/median.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `median.config.json` - Median.co configuration

### Modified Files
- `App.tsx` - Updated to use navigation hook
- `components/Navbar.tsx` - Updated navigation handling
- `tsconfig.json` - Added type definitions path
- `package.json` - Added median-js-bridge dependency

## Testing the Fix

### In Development (Web)
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate between sections using the navbar
3. Use browser back/forward buttons to test history
4. Check browser URL updates with hash fragments

### In Median.co App
1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Median.co platform
3. Test swipe gestures on mobile device
4. Verify back gestures navigate between sections instead of closing app

## Configuration for Median.co

Ensure your Median.co app configuration includes:
```json
{
  "interface": {
    "swipeGestures": {
      "enabled": true,
      "backGesture": true,
      "forwardGesture": true
    },
    "navigation": {
      "enableSPANavigation": true,
      "historyManagement": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging

### Console Logs
The navigation service provides detailed console logs:
- Navigation events
- Median Bridge initialization
- URL parsing
- History management

### Check Median Bridge
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(typeof median !== 'undefined' && median.isNativeApp());
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Navigation**: Swipe gestures now navigate between sections
2. **Better UX**: Consistent navigation behavior across web and mobile
3. **Deep Linking**: URLs can be shared and bookmarked
4. **History Support**: Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
5. **Future-Proof**: Extensible for additional navigation features

## Maintenance Notes

- The navigation service is designed to be extensible
- New sections can be added by updating the `AppSection` type
- URL parsing can be enhanced for more complex routing needs
- Additional Median.co features can be integrated through the bridge

This solution provides a robust foundation for navigation in Median.co apps while maintaining compatibility with web browsers.
