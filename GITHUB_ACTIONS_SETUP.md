## 🔐 Production Build Setup (With Signing):

### Step 1: Prepare Keystore for GitHub

cd android
base64 -w 0 budget-tracker-key.keystore > keystore.base64
```

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"** and add these:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Contents of `keystore.base64` file |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `budgettracker2024` |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | `budgettracker2024` |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `budget-tracker` |

### Step 3: Run Production Build
