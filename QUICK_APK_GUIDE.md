# Quick APK Build Guide - Network Issues Workaround

## The Problem
Your network/firewall is blocking Gradle downloads, which is preventing the APK build.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Android Studio (Recommended)
This is the easiest way since Android Studio handles all downloads and dependencies:

1. **Download Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install it** with default settings
3. **Open the project**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Choose "Open an existing project"
   - Navigate to your `android/` folder
   - Let Android Studio download everything automatically
4. **Build APK**:
   - In Android Studio: Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
   - APK will be created in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

### Option 2: Manual Gradle Download
If you want to stick with command line:

1. **Download Gradle manually**:
   - Go to: https://gradle.org/releases/
   - Download Gradle 8.10.2 (Complete distribution)
   - Extract to `C:\gradle\gradle-8.10.2`

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```cmd
   set GRADLE_HOME=C:\gradle\gradle-8.10.2
   set PATH=%GRADLE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
   set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.15.6-hotspot
   ```

3. **Build APK**:
   ```cmd
   cd android
   gradle assembleDebug
   ```

### Option 3: Use Different Network
- Try building from a different network (home, mobile hotspot)
- Corporate networks often block these downloads

### Option 4: Online Build Service
Use GitHub Actions or similar to build the APK online:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
3. Download the built APK from the workflow

## Quick Test - Try This First

Let me try one more approach with a different Gradle version:

```cmd
# Set Java path
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.15.6-hotspot
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

# Try with offline mode (if Gradle was partially downloaded)
cd android
gradlew.bat assembleDebug --offline
```

## What's Already Done ✅

Your app is fully configured and ready:
- ✅ Capacitor setup complete
- ✅ Android project generated
- ✅ Web app built and synced
- ✅ All configurations in place

The only issue is downloading Gradle due to network restrictions.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try Android Studio** - It's the most reliable option
2. **Or try from a different network** - Home internet usually works better
3. **Or ask your IT department** to whitelist gradle.org downloads

Once you get past the Gradle download, the APK will build successfully!

## APK Location (once built)
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

This file can be directly installed on your Android phone for testing.
